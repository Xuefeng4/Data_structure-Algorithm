You cautiously climb through the hole and hide into the bush,
Someone is talking. You try to get closer and wonder what are they talking about.
"Why do we waste time here", "Isn't Bill Gates more important ? And he worths a lot of money." Another guy talks, "If we know where Bill Gates
is, this guy should be dead already, He is the only one who knows where Bill is. We need to keep him."

Luckily the box is still in your pocket,"wait what? there guys are not coming for the box."
"But there is a sign on theses guards' clothes, It is totally different from the one on the robbers' clothes that day."

You think there guys looks stupid, Apparently Bill is not in their hands, If they only want money, maybe you can take advantages of them to help you find Bill

I'd better go now, what if I make a wrong judgement. These guys are also dangerous.
