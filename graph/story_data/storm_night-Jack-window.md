You spent a lot of strength climbing out of the window.
The moment you are landing, "Hey, how can you come out?","Are you still okay",
"I have been looking for you a whole day." But you just cannot remember who she is, maybe you do not know her.
Your headache begins to get worse. When she's holding you by the arm, you see a tatoo on her arm which is exactly same as the sign on the robbers's clothes. "You looks not well at all, come with me, I will make sure you are safe."

Your headache is a torturous, you choose to go with her and get some help, also she may know where to find Bill.

Something weird, you choose to run, it is not safe to go with her.
