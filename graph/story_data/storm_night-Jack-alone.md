You are now temporary safe and hiding behind the tree, but wait, you need to find Bill,
You cannot just stay here, But how? Suddenly, you see a man not far wearing a suit with the exact same sign is getting on a truck. You sneak all the way and get on the back of the truck.

"What hell is this place?" You are taking to a building looks like an abandoned Laboratory,"Anyway, Bill may be inside."
You want to try to find a way sneaking in not being caught.
There is a ventilator duct exit leading into the building, maybe this is a good choice.
But what more appealing is that the guard at the front door is sleeping! What a great chance!

What if he just woke up, I'd better go from the duct.

I do not know where the duct will lead to, and the guard is sleeping, It is safe.
