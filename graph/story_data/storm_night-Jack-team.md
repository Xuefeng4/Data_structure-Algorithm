You told the three guys that you do not know where Bill is
but you know someone else robbed him, If they can help find Bill,
he can offer as much as they want. The three guys considered for a while
and agree to go with you.

You draws the strange sign to them and one of them said"I know it is them, they never stops causing me troubles!"
"Great, you know what this is? Can you take me to their nest?"
He says," Sure, but these people are not easy to deal with, remember you offer."
"Sure"

Then you are taking to a building looks like a abandoned Laboratory,"Anyway, Bill may be inside"
You guys plans to find a way sneaking in not being caught.
There is a ventilator duct exit leading into the building, maybe this is a good choice.
But what more appealing is that the guard at the front door is sleeping! What a great chance!

What if he just woke up, We'd better go from the duct.

We do not know where the duct will lead to, and the guard is sleeping, It is safe.
