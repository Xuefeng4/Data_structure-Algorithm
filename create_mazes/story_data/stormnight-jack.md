A deafening thunder broke the silence of the night. You are woken up by the loud and hearing rain pouring outside. "Where am I?", you are lying in the dark with a headache. "What happened?" You just tried to remember and the efforts to remember make your headache worse. You are thrilling in the dark and suddenly everything just came back to your mind. You are Jack, the assistant of Bill Gates. One day your car was stopped by a group of people wearing clothes with strange sign. And Bill Gates was hijacked, he handed you a box in danger and told you that it was more important than your life. You put the box in your pocket and were ready to ask for help. Unexpectedly, your head was attacked and you lost consciousness, then you woke up in the room. You know you need to get out of here. Luckily the box is still in your pocket.

Suddenly, The dark was illuminated by forked lightning. You noticed that you are in a square room with walls surrounded. Lightening after lightening, you becomes more familiar with this confined space. There is a broken window right behind you, and also a strange round sign on the wall just next to the window. You can see rain is pouring in and some shadow maybe outside. There is a huge hole on the left corner of the wall right in front of you, and surprisingly the door on your right is not locked, a lock is hanging on it but not locked, maybe the person who took you here just forgets? You need to choose a way out!

# storm_night-Jack-door
After a moment, you chooses to get out from the door.

# storm_night-Jack-hole
"Although the hole is dirty, but maybe it is the safest ?" You are talking to yourself and go towards the hole.

# storm_night-Jack-window
"Maybe someone is outside the window? I may can get help. I will jump from the window." You are thinking.
